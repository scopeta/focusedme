# FocusedMe v0.1.83 Release Notes

## Windows Installation Fix

This release addresses the installation issues on Windows platforms by making the following improvements:

### What's Changed

- **Simplified Windows Support**: Now using the built-in `winsound` module from the Python standard library
- **Removed Dependencies**: Eliminated the need for both `simpleaudio` and `playsound` on Windows
- **Zero-Dependency Audio**: Windows users now get audio notifications without any additional packages

### Technical Details

- Added platform detection to use the appropriate audio playback method:
  - Windows: `winsound.PlaySound()` from the standard library
  - macOS: `afplay` command via subprocess
  - Linux/Other: `simpleaudio` library for WAV playback
- Improved error handling for all audio playback methods
- Added platform-specific tests with appropriate skipping on non-applicable platforms

### Installation Process

Installation is now simpler for all users:

```
pip install focusedme
```

No additional setup required for any platform!

### Test Coverage

- Added tests for the `winsound` implementation on Windows
- Maintained existing tests for macOS and Linux platforms
- Added platform-specific test skipping for better CI compatibility

### Documentation Updates

- Updated platform support information in documentation
- Enhanced Windows installation guide
- Improved code comments and docstrings
- Added detailed platform-specific notes in README
